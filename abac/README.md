**ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control) Support for Spring**

Sometimes ACL is too much and RBAC is not enough.
Attribute-Based Access Control is something in between and allows more fine granulate "access rules"  

Please check the Spring Manual for more details.

Inspired by articles like
[ATTRIBUTE BASED ACCESS CONTROL (ABAC) - OVERVIEW][1] by [NIST.gov](NIST.gov) and [Wikipedia][2]
