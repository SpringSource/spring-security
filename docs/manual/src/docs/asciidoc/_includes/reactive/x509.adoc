= Reactive X.509 Authentication

Similar to <<servlet-x509,Servlet X.509 authentication>>, the reactive x509 authentication filter allows extracting an authentication token from a certificate provided by a client.

The folloiwng example shows a reactive x509 security configuration:

====
[source,java]
----
@Bean
public SecurityWebFilterChain securityWebFilterChain(ServerHttpSecurity http) {
	http
		.x509(withDefaults())
		.authorizeExchange(exchanges -> exchanges
		    .anyExchange().permitAll()
		);
	return http.build();
}
----
====

In the preceding configuration, when neither `principalExtractor` nor `authenticationManager` is provided, defaults are used. The default principal extractor is `SubjectDnX509PrincipalExtractor`, which extracts the CN (common name) field from a certificate provided by a client. The default authentication manager is `ReactivePreAuthenticatedAuthenticationManager`, which performs user account validation, checking that a user account with a name extracted by `principalExtractor` exists and that it is not locked, disabled, or expired.

The following example demonstrates how these defaults can be overridden:

====
[source,java]
----
@Bean
public SecurityWebFilterChain securityWebFilterChain(ServerHttpSecurity http) {
	SubjectDnX509PrincipalExtractor principalExtractor =
	        new SubjectDnX509PrincipalExtractor();

	principalExtractor.setSubjectDnRegex("OU=(.*?)(?:,|$)");

	ReactiveAuthenticationManager authenticationManager = authentication -> {
		authentication.setAuthenticated("Trusted Org Unit".equals(authentication.getName()));
		return Mono.just(authentication);
	};

	http
		.x509(x509 -> x509
		    .principalExtractor(principalExtractor)
		    .authenticationManager(authenticationManager)
		)
		.authorizeExchange(exchanges -> exchanges
		    .anyExchange().authenticated()
		);
	return http.build();
}
----
====

In the previous example, a username is extracted from the OU field of a client certificate instead of CN, and account lookup using `ReactiveUserDetailsService` is not performed at all. Instead, if the provided certificate issued to an OU named "`Trusted Org Unit`", a request is authenticated.

For an example of configuring Netty and `WebClient` or `curl` command-line tool to use mutual TLS and enable X.509 authentication, see https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security-samples/tree/main/servlet/java-configuration/authentication/x509.
