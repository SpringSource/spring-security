[[servlet-authentication-authenticationmanager]]
= AuthenticationManager

{security-api-url}org/springframework/security/authentication/AuthenticationManager.html[`AuthenticationManager`] is the API that defines how Spring Security's Filters perform  <<authentication,authentication>>.
The <<servlet-authentication-authentication,`Authentication`>> that is returned is then set on the <<servlet-authentication-securitycontextholder>> by the controller (that is, by <<servlet-security-filters,Spring Security's `Filters` instances>>) that invoked the `AuthenticationManager`.
If you are not integrating with Spring Security's `Filters` instances, you can set the `SecurityContextHolder` directly and are not required to use an `AuthenticationManager`.

While the implementation of `AuthenticationManager` could be anything, the most common implementation is <<servlet-authentication-providermanager,`ProviderManager`>>.
