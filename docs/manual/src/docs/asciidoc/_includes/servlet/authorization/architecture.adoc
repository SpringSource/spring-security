= Authorization Architecture

This section describes the Spring Security architecture that applies to authorization.

[[authz-authorities]]
== Authorities
<<servlet-authentication-authentication,`Authentication`>> discusses how all `Authentication` implementations store a list of `GrantedAuthority` objects.
These represent the authorities that have been granted to the principal.
The `GrantedAuthority` objects are inserted into the `Authentication` object by the `AuthenticationManager` and are later read by `AccessDecisionManager` instances when making authorization decisions.

The `GrantedAuthority` interface has only one method:

====
[source,java]
----
String getAuthority();
----
====

This method lets an
`AccessDecisionManager` instance to obtain a precise `String` representation of the `GrantedAuthority`.
By returning a representation as a `String`, a `GrantedAuthority` can be easily "`read`" by most `AccessDecisionManager` implementations.
If a `GrantedAuthority` cannot be precisely represented as a `String`, the `GrantedAuthority` is considered "`complex`" and `getAuthority()` must return `null`.

An example of a "`complex`" `GrantedAuthority` would be an implementation that stores a list of operations and authority thresholds that apply to different customer account numbers.
Representing this complex `GrantedAuthority` as a `String` would be quite difficult. As a result, the `getAuthority()` method should return `null`.
This indicates to any `AccessDecisionManager` that it needs to support the specific `GrantedAuthority` implementation to understand its contents.

Spring Security includes one concrete `GrantedAuthority` implementation: `SimpleGrantedAuthority`.
This implementation lets any user-specified `String` be converted into a `GrantedAuthority`.
All `AuthenticationProvider` instances included with the security architecture use `SimpleGrantedAuthority` to populate the `Authentication` object.


[[authz-pre-invocation]]
== Pre-Invocation Handling
Spring Security provides interceptors that control access to secure objects, such as method invocations or web requests.
A pre-invocation decision on whether the invocation is allowed to proceed is made by the `AccessDecisionManager`.


[[authz-access-decision-manager]]
=== The AccessDecisionManager
The `AccessDecisionManager` is called by the `AbstractSecurityInterceptor` and is responsible for making final access control decisions.
The `AccessDecisionManager` interface contains three methods:

====
[source,java]
----
void decide(Authentication authentication, Object secureObject,
	Collection<ConfigAttribute> attrs) throws AccessDeniedException;

boolean supports(ConfigAttribute attribute);

boolean supports(Class clazz);
----
====

The `decide` method of the `AccessDecisionManager` is passed all the relevant information it needs to make an authorization decision.
In particular, passing the secure `Object` lets those arguments contained in the actual secure object invocation be inspected.
For example, assume the secure object is a `MethodInvocation`.
You can query the `MethodInvocation` for any `Customer` argument and then implement some sort of security logic in the `AccessDecisionManager` to ensure the principal is permitted to operate on that customer.
Implementations are expected to throw an `AccessDeniedException` if access is denied.

The `supports(ConfigAttribute)` method is called by the `AbstractSecurityInterceptor` at startup time to determine if the `AccessDecisionManager` can process the passed `ConfigAttribute`.
The `supports(Class)` method is called by a security interceptor implementation to ensure the configured `AccessDecisionManager` supports the type of secure object that the security interceptor presents.

[[authz-voting-based]]
=== Voting-Based AccessDecisionManager Implementations
While users can implement their own `AccessDecisionManager` to control all aspects of authorization, Spring Security includes several `AccessDecisionManager` implementations that are based on voting.
<<authz-access-voting>> describes the relevant classes.

The following image shows the `AccessDecisionManager` interface:

[[authz-access-voting]]
.Voting Decision Manager

By using this approach, a series of `AccessDecisionVoter` implementations are polled on an authorization decision.
The `AccessDecisionManager` then decides whether or not to throw an `AccessDeniedException` based on its assessment of the votes.

The `AccessDecisionVoter` interface has three methods:

====
[source,java]
----
int vote(Authentication authentication, Object object, Collection<ConfigAttribute> attrs);

boolean supports(ConfigAttribute attribute);

boolean supports(Class clazz);
----
====

Concrete implementations return an `int`, with possible values being reflected in the `AccessDecisionVoter` static fields named `ACCESS_ABSTAIN`, `ACCESS_DENIED` and `ACCESS_GRANTED`.
A voting implementation returns `ACCESS_ABSTAIN` if it has no opinion on an authorization decision.
If it does have an opinion, it must return either `ACCESS_DENIED` or `ACCESS_GRANTED`.

There are three concrete `AccessDecisionManager` implementations provided with Spring Security to tally the votes.
The `ConsensusBased` implementation grants or denies access based on the consensus of non-abstain votes.
Properties are provided to control behavior in the event of an equality of votes or if all votes are abstain.
The `AffirmativeBased` implementation grants access if one or more `ACCESS_GRANTED` votes were received (in other words, a deny vote will be ignored, provided there was at least one grant vote).
Like the `ConsensusBased` implementation, there is a parameter that controls the behavior if all voters abstain.
The `UnanimousBased` provider expects unanimous `ACCESS_GRANTED` votes in order to grant access, ignoring abstains.
It denies access if there is any `ACCESS_DENIED` vote.
Like the other implementations, there is a parameter that controls the behavior if all voters abstain.

You can implement a custom `AccessDecisionManager` that tallies votes differently.
For example, votes from a particular `AccessDecisionVoter` might receive additional weighting, while a deny vote from a particular voter may have a veto effect.


[[authz-role-voter]]
==== RoleVoter
The most commonly used `AccessDecisionVoter` provided with Spring Security is the `RoleVoter`, which treats configuration attributes as role names and votes to grant access if the user has been assigned that role.

It votes if any `ConfigAttribute` begins with the `ROLE_` prefix.
It votes to grant access if there is a `GrantedAuthority` that returns a `String` representation (from the `getAuthority()` method) exactly equal to one or more `ConfigAttributes` that start with the `ROLE_` prefix.
If there is no exact match of any `ConfigAttribute` starting with `ROLE_`, `RoleVoter` votes to deny access.
If no `ConfigAttribute` begins with `ROLE_`, the voter abstains.


[[authz-authenticated-voter]]
==== AuthenticatedVoter
Another voter which we have implicitly seen is the `AuthenticatedVoter`, which can be used to differentiate between anonymous, fully-authenticated, and remember-me authenticated users.
Many sites allow certain limited access under remember-me authentication but require a user to confirm their identity by logging in for full access.

When we have used the `IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY` attribute to grant anonymous access, this attribute was being processed by the `AuthenticatedVoter`.
For more information, see
{security-api-url}org/springframework/security/access/vote/AuthenticatedVoter.html[`AuthenticatedVoter`].

[[authz-custom-voter]]
==== Custom Voters
You can also implement a custom `AccessDecisionVoter` and put just about any access-control logic you want in it.
It might be specific to your application (business-logic related) or it might implement some security administration logic.
For example, on the Spring web site, you can find a https://spring.io/blog/2009/01/03/spring-security-customization-part-2-adjusting-secured-session-in-real-time[blog article] that describes how to use a voter to deny access in real-time to users whose accounts have been suspended.


[[authz-after-invocation-handling]]
== After Invocation Handling
While the `AccessDecisionManager` is called by the `AbstractSecurityInterceptor` before proceeding with the secure object invocation, some applications need a way to modify the object actually returned by the secure object invocation.
While you could implement your own AOP concern to achieve this, Spring Security provides a convenient hook that has several concrete implementations that integrate with its ACL capabilities.

<<authz-after-invocation>> describes Spring Security's `AfterInvocationManager` and its concrete implementations.
The following image shows the `AfterInvocationManager`:

[[authz-after-invocation]]
.After Invocation Implementation
image::images/after-invocation.png[]

Like many other parts of Spring Security, `AfterInvocationManager` has a single concrete implementation, `AfterInvocationProviderManager`, which polls a list of `AfterInvocationProvider` instances.
Each `AfterInvocationProvider` is allowed to modify the return object or throw an `AccessDeniedException`.
Indeed, multiple providers can modify the object, as the result of the previous provider is passed to the next in the list.

Note that, if you use `AfterInvocationManager`, you still need configuration attributes to let the `AccessDecisionManager` of the `MethodSecurityInterceptor` allow an operation.
If you use the typical Spring Security `AccessDecisionManager` implementations, having no configuration attributes defined for a particular secure method invocation causes each `AccessDecisionVoter` to abstain from voting.
In turn, if the `allowIfAllAbstainDecisions` property of `AccessDecisionManager` is `false`, an `AccessDeniedException` is thrown.
You may avoid this potential issue by either (i) setting `allowIfAllAbstainDecisions` to `true` (although this is generally not recommended) or (ii) ensuring that there is at least one configuration attribute for which an `AccessDecisionVoter` votes to grant access.
This latter (recommended) approach is usually achieved through a `ROLE_USER` or `ROLE_AUTHENTICATED` configuration attribute.


[[authz-hierarchical-roles]]
== Hierarchical Roles
It is a common requirement that a particular role in an application should automatically "`include`" other roles.
For example, in an application which has the concept of an "admin" and a "user" role, you may want an admin to be able to do everything a normal user can.
To achieve this, you can either make sure that all admin users are also assigned the "`user`" role or you can modify every access constraint which requires the "`user`" role to also include the "`admin`" role.
This can get complicated if you have a lot of different roles in your application.

The use of a role-hierarchy lets you configure which roles (or authorities) should include others.
An extended version of Spring Security's <<authz-role-voter,RoleVoter>>, `RoleHierarchyVoter`, is configured with a `RoleHierarchy`, from which it obtains all the "`reachable authorities`" that the user is assigned.
The following example shows a typical configuration:

====
[source,xml]
----
<bean id="roleVoter" class="org.springframework.security.access.vote.RoleHierarchyVoter">
	<constructor-arg ref="roleHierarchy" />
</bean>
<bean id="roleHierarchy"
		class="org.springframework.security.access.hierarchicalroles.RoleHierarchyImpl">
	<property name="hierarchy">
		<value>
			ROLE_ADMIN > ROLE_STAFF
			ROLE_STAFF > ROLE_USER
			ROLE_USER > ROLE_GUEST
		</value>
	</property>
</bean>
----
====

Here, we have four roles in a hierarchy `ROLE_ADMIN => ROLE_STAFF => ROLE_USER => ROLE_GUEST`.
A user who is authenticated with `ROLE_ADMIN` behaves as if they have all four roles when security constraints are evaluated against an `AccessDecisionManager` configured with the preceding `RoleHierarchyVoter`.
The `>` symbol can be thought of as meaning "`includes`".

Role hierarchies offer a convenient means of simplifying the access-control configuration data for your application and reducing the number of authorities that you need to assign to a user.
For more complex requirements, you may wish to define a logical mapping between the specific access-rights your application requires and the roles that are assigned to users, translating between the two when loading the user information.
