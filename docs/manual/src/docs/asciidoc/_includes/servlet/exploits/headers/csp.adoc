= Content Security Policy (CSP)

https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2/[Content Security Policy (CSP)] is a mechanism that web applications can leverage to mitigate content injection vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS).
CSP is a declarative policy that provides a facility for web application authors to declare and ultimately inform the client (user-agent) about the sources from which the web application expects to load resources.

[NOTE]
====
Content Security Policy is not intended to solve all content injection vulnerabilities.
Instead, CSP can be leveraged to help reduce the harm caused by content injection attacks.
As a first line of defense, web application authors should validate their input and encode their output.
====

A web application may employ the use of CSP by including one of the following HTTP headers in the response:

* *_Content-Security-Policy_*
* *_Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only_*

Each of these headers are used as a mechanism to deliver a *_security policy_* to the client.
A security policy contains a set of *_security policy directives_* (for example, _script-src_ and _object-src_), each responsible for declaring the restrictions for a particular resource representation.

For example, a web application can declare that it expects to load scripts from specific, trusted sources, by including the following header in the response:

[source]
----
Content-Security-Policy: script-src https://trustedscripts.example.com
----

An attempt to load a script from another source other than what is declared in the _script-src_ directive will be blocked by the user-agent.
Additionally, if the https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2/#directive-report-uri[*_report-uri_*] directive is declared in the security policy, then the violation will be reported by the user-agent to the declared URL.

For example, if a web application violates the declared security policy, the following response header will instruct the user-agent to send violation reports to the URL specified in the policy's _report-uri_ directive.

[source]
----
Content-Security-Policy: script-src https://trustedscripts.example.com; report-uri /csp-report-endpoint/
----

https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2/#violation-reports[*_Violation reports_*] are standard JSON structures that can be captured either by the web application's own API or by a publicly hosted CSP violation reporting service, such as, https://report-uri.io/[*_REPORT-URI_*].

The *_Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only_* header provides the capability for web application authors and administrators to monitor security policies, rather than enforce them.
This header is typically used when experimenting and/or developing security policies for a site.
When a policy is deemed effective, it can be enforced by using the _Content-Security-Policy_ header field instead.

Given the following response header, the policy declares that scripts may be loaded from one of two possible sources.

[source]
----
Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only: script-src 'self' https://trustedscripts.example.com; report-uri /csp-report-endpoint/
----

If the site violates this policy, by attempting to load a script from _evil.com_, the user-agent will send a violation report to the declared URL specified by the _report-uri_ directive, but still allow the violating resource to load nevertheless.


[[headers-csp-configure]]
== Configuring Content Security Policy

It's important to note that Spring Security *_does not add_* Content Security Policy by default.
The web application author must declare the security policy(s) to enforce and/or monitor for the protected resources.

For example, given the following security policy:

[source]
----
script-src 'self' https://trustedscripts.example.com; object-src https://trustedplugins.example.com; report-uri /csp-report-endpoint/
----

You can enable the CSP header using XML configuration with the <<nsa-content-security-policy,<content-security-policy>>> element as shown below:

[source,xml]
----
<http>
	<!-- ... -->

	<headers>
		<content-security-policy
			policy-directives="script-src 'self' https://trustedscripts.example.com; object-src https://trustedplugins.example.com; report-uri /csp-report-endpoint/" />
	</headers>
</http>
----

To enable the CSP _'report-only'_ header, configure the element as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<http>
	<!-- ... -->

	<headers>
		<content-security-policy
			policy-directives="script-src 'self' https://trustedscripts.example.com; object-src https://trustedplugins.example.com; report-uri /csp-report-endpoint/"
			report-only="true" />
	</headers>
</http>
----

Similarly, you can enable the CSP header using Java configuration as shown below:

[source,java]
----
@EnableWebSecurity
public class WebSecurityConfig extends
WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
	http
	// ...
	.headers()
		.contentSecurityPolicy("script-src 'self' https://trustedscripts.example.com; object-src https://trustedplugins.example.com; report-uri /csp-report-endpoint/");
}
}
----

To enable the CSP _'report-only'_ header, provide the following Java configuration:

[source,java]
----
@EnableWebSecurity
public class WebSecurityConfig extends
WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
	http
	// ...
	.headers()
		.contentSecurityPolicy("script-src 'self' https://trustedscripts.example.com; object-src https://trustedplugins.example.com; report-uri /csp-report-endpoint/")
		.reportOnly();
}
}
