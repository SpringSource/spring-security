[[headers-referrer]]
= Referrer Policy

https://www.w3.org/TR/referrer-policy[Referrer Policy] is a mechanism that web applications can leverage to manage the referrer field, which contains the last
page the user was on.

Spring Security's approach is to use https://www.w3.org/TR/referrer-policy/[Referrer Policy] header, which provides different https://www.w3.org/TR/referrer-policy/#referrer-policies[policies]:

[source]
----
Referrer-Policy: same-origin
----

The Referrer-Policy response header instructs the browser to let the destination knows the source where the user was previously.

[[headers-referrer-configure]]
== Configuring Referrer Policy

Spring Security *_doesn't add_* Referrer Policy header by default.

You can enable the Referrer-Policy header using XML configuration with the <<nsa-referrer-policy,<referrer-policy>>> element as shown below:

[source,xml]
----
<http>
	<!-- ... -->

	<headers>
		<referrer-policy policy="same-origin" />
	</headers>
</http>
----

Similarly, you can enable the Referrer Policy header using Java configuration as shown below:

[source,java]
----
@EnableWebSecurity
public class WebSecurityConfig extends
WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
	http
	// ...
	.headers()
		.referrerPolicy(ReferrerPolicy.SAME_ORIGIN);
}
}
----
