= Overriding Defaults
Spring Security's goal is to provide defaults that protect your users from exploits.
This does not mean that you are forced to accept all of its defaults.

For example, you can provide a custom CsrfTokenRepository to override the way in which the `CsrfToken` is stored.

You can also specify a custom RequestMatcher to determine which requests are protected by CSRF (i.e. perhaps you don't care if log out is exploited).
In short, if Spring Security's CSRF protection doesn't behave exactly as you want it, you are able to customize the behavior.
Refer to the <<nsa-csrf>> documentation for details on how to make these customizations with XML and the `CsrfConfigurer` javadoc for details on how to make these customizations when using Java configuration.
