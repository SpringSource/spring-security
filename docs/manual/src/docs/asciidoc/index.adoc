// FIXME: The current authorization link is for the servlet architecture. We need a reactive link, too. (On a deeper level, we need an authorization topic that accounts for both paths.)
Spring Security is a framework that provides <<authentication,authentication>>, <<servlet-authorization,authorization>>, and protection against <<exploits,common attacks>>.
